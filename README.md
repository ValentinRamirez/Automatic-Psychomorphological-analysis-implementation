# First Approach on Automated Psychomorphological Analysis implementation

Morfopsychology is a phycological discipline, that has established some correlations
between the shapes of the different parts of the face and the psychological
profile of a person. It has become very trendy in the recent years, but itâ€™s origins
are very antique.

In recent years, deep learning and computer vision has been
applied to multiple fields of human activity and specifically to psychology with
some works in the field of "Affective Computation".

This work is a first atempt, without trying to check the veracity of it's theories, to automate the morfopsychological analysis.
